# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
Seth and Tom gave me the task of getting data from a recent election. The data included the candidates, counties, voters, and which candidate won the popular vote based on the number of voters.

I was able to calculate the number of votes.
List the candidates what received votes.
List the number of votes each candidate received.
Translate the number of votes each candidate received into a percentage.
Determine a winner based of popular vote.

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.cvs
Software: Python 3.8.9, Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
There were 369,711 votes cast in this election.
The candidates were:
  Charles Casper Stockham
  Diana DeGett
  Raymon Anthony Doane
The candidates results were:
  Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
The winner of the election was:

## Challenge Overview
  Some of the difficulties I faced with this challenge was when to input code into VSC or the VSC Terminal section. I also ran into some trouble with the code but I was able to redo it to find my mistakes.

## Challenge Summary
  I was able to analyze the election data to find the voter count, the candidates, the number of votes/percentage which candidate received, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. Diana DeGette won this election with 73.8% of the votes, which is 272,892 votes.
